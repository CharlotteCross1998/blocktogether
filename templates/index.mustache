    <h1>Block Together (beta)</h1>
    <p>
    An app intended to help cope with harassers and abusers on
    Twitter. When you sign up for Block Together, you can view a list of your
    own blocks. You can also use the auto-block and block sharing options
    listed below.
    </p>
    <p>
    <b>Update</b>: Block subscriptions are coming soon, please check out the
    design doc at <a

    Block Together will not tweet on your behalf, but it needs read/write
    access to your account in order to block people when you ask it to.
    Twitter describes that permission as 'Post tweets for you.'

    <h2>Details</h2>
    <p>
    When you share your list of blocks with friends, they will have the option
    to sign up for Block Together and block some or all of the people on your
    list. In the future, Block Together will also allow you to subscribe to
    friends' block lists so that you automatically block any new users they
    add.
    </p>
    <p>
    Block Together records all actions it takes on your behalf and lists them
    under the 'Actions' tab, so you can figure out why someone is blocked.
    Block Together will not block someone you are already following, even if
    they are included in a friend's block list that you block. It will also
    not re-block someone if it blocked them through the 'block new accounts'
    feature and you then unblocked them.
    </p>

    This is very much beta software. My hope is to provide something useful
    enough to be interesting, and build a community to help develop it.
    Everyone is welcome. Skills especially needed: Graphic design, UX design,
    HTML, CSS, and Javascript coding (the backend is in Node), and Ops.
